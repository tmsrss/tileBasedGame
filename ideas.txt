randomize the spawn location using spawn obstacles
change image when shotgun
as difficulty and waves increase, the night should switch on, change from switching on with n key. Use hard file first the even harder medium and light. ALso change the NIGHT_COLOR setting, all number higher eg (50, 50, 50) and LIGHT_RADIUS aswell for easier
As waves go by, boss is needed. The boss can be a subclass of the Mob class.
can also change lighting/fog/night effect https://www.redblobgames.com/articles/visibility/ to make so the it does not ight up inside of house when close to outside wall
when spawning items in random locations, should check that when spawning it does not appear on screen.
	Do this by taking the grid coordinates of the viwable map and check if the randomly selected spawn location is in it. If it is should randomize again.
